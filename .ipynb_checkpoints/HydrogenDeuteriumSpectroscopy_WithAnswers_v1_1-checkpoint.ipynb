    "## 1.0 Atomic physics - a perspective\n",
    "The idea that matter is made of ultimate particles called atoms goes back to ancient Greek civilization. However, this fundamental view of matter was not completely accepted even by the beginning of the twentieth century. The problem was that there was, until recently, no way to directly verify the existence of such small particles. Now we do have sufficiently good microscopes and are comfortable with the idea that the smallest identifiable piece of any element is indeed the atom. We further understand that atoms themselves are composed of more fundamental particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. At the atomic scale, the rules of classical physics break down and it is necessary to describe behavior of atomic systems using quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Atomic and molecular physics aims to understand the internal structure of atoms and how this structure affects the interaction of atoms with their environment, particularly electromagnetic radiation, atomic and electron beams, surrounding atoms, and surfaces. This understanding lays the foundation for several other key areas of physics. For example, chemical physics applies atomic theory to understand the formation and behavior of molecules, while condensed matter physics seeks the connection between the properties of individual atoms and the behavior of atoms aggregated into liquids and solids.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hydrogen atom is the simplest atom and establishes the foundation for all of the rest of atomic physics. The detailed understanding of the hydrogen atom creates a model for how physics is done, a process that is in many ways distinct from other disciplines such as biology or engineering. Extremely precise experiments are devised to extract quantitative tests of ever more subtle phenomena. Out of this systematic, detailed quantitative study come comprehensive, far-reaching models that apply to much more than atomic hydrogen itself. Thus the simplicity of the system does not imply that the conclusions drawn from its study are trivial or isolated to that system alone. This is a pattern for much of the rest of physics and is a major part of the power and joy of the discipline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The build-up of larger atoms with more constituent protons, neutrons, and electrons also creates a pattern for physical modeling. In this case, the task is to understand moderately complex systems by separating out dominant interactions and making successive approximations to a basic model. The systematic approach to solving Schrödinger's equations for multi-electron atoms uses such approximation methods and combines them with a fundamental idea called the Pauli exclusion principle to produce a powerfully useful picture of atomic structure. This picture is based on a hierarchy of energy levels or shells that are successively filled as electrons are added to a bare nucleus to create a neutral atom. Even without calculating the details, the idea of the shell structure related to the basic model of the hydrogen atom successfully explains the remarkable ordering of elemental chemical properties into the system called the periodic table. Nowadays, sophisticated numerical modeling allows us to fill in the details and predict new phenomena and new ways of manipulating atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the behavior of atomic interactions with other atoms can be understood in terms of the most weakly bound electrons: this leads to comprehensive theories of molecules, chemical bonds, adhesion of atoms to surfaces, and even the conformation of  complexes of large biological molecules. Meanwhile, deeply-bound electrons can be probed by x-rays or by scattering of very energetic electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Atoms can be manipulated with exquisite delicacy using models of their internal structure and predictions of the responses induced by carefully tuned and timed pulses of light. Thus it is possible to use lasers to cool and trap atoms. It is also possible to observe effects of the quantum interference of atoms viewed as matter waves, and the condensation of a certain class of identical atoms into a single coherent ground state called a Bose condensate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optical spectroscopy, the measurement of light as it interacts with matter as a function of wavelength (or energy) of the light, is an extremely important tool in atomic physics. Instruments of great precision, such as diffraction gratings, interferometers, photomultiplier tube detectors, and stabilized lasers, form the tools of the trade. Light levels can vary from the brightness of an intense arc to a few photons per second. Time scales can be as short as femtoseconds and length scales as large as distance across the known universe (where atoms are detected using their characteristic emissions). Wavelengths span ranges from radio (meters) to visible (hundreds of nanometers) to x-rays (nanometers). The precision of atomic and molecular spectroscopy yields several fundamental technologies, such as the atomic clock and the laser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another other major type of experiment in atomic and molecular physics uses atomic or molecular beams, and combinations of such beam experiments with electromagnetic probes. Technologies for very high vacuums and ultra-clean surfaces are often involved, and this combination of beams, vacuum systems, optics, etc. has been translated into a wide range of practical technologies for studying and manufacturing advanced technological materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of a fundamental quantum mechanical property of atoms and their constituents called spin is the basis for phenomena called magnetic resonance. Magnetic moments associated with these spins give atoms and aggregates of atoms special properties in the presence of magnetic fields. These properties can be manipulated and detected with great precision. The effect of local environments on such properties provides a means to identify chemical compounds and structures called magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The ability to combine clever timing techniques and spatial magnetic field gradients allows these properties to be mapped in three-dimensional space and is the basis for the important medical technology called magnetic resonance imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, tools for the efficient manipulation of individual atoms at the nanometer scale are opening up an area of development called nanotechnology. The exciting prospect exists that useful machines and processes can be custom-designed at the atomic and molecular scale. The impact of such capabilities is expected to be enormous and broad, ranging from information technology to solar energy conversion to biomedicine.\n",

    "## 1.1 Spectroscopy of hydrogen - an overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this experiment is to relate precise spectroscopic measurements of light from a hydrogen discharge lamp to a heirarchy of more comprehensive models of the structure of atomic hydrogen. The starting point is the Bohr model, developed in 1913 to make a first synthesis of ideas about quantization and the experimental evidence that atoms had dense massive cores (nuclei) surrounded by fast moving electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bohr model starts with a classical picture of a negatively-charged electron orbiting a positively-charged nucleaus under the action of a central force, namely Coulomb attraction between oppositely charged particles. We will initially use this semi-classical model for two purposes. The first purpose is to create a readily-derived heuristic for quantifying the overall features of the observed spectrum by explaining the exquisite regularity in the location of the spectral lines. Although we now understand that the Bohr model was overly simplistic and that a full treatment requires quantum mechanics expressed through Schrödinger's equation, this heuristic approach is important for the following reason: it is an example of how one builds bridges of explanation to explain new phenomena using an adroitly chosen mixture of conventional models and critical new assumptions. The hydrogen spectrum itself is now \"old news\", but new phenomena occur across all the fields of physics whose first exploration requires such bridging models. If you are the first to create such a bridge, you may have the privelege of having the model named after you!\n",
    "\n",
    "The other use of the Bohr model is to demonstrate how to convert the two-body problem with mutually acting forces into an equivalent single-body problem under a central force. This will introduce the idea of reduced mass and provide the basic quantitative understanding we need to interpret measurements of the shift in spectral lines emitted by the isotope deuterium compared to lines emitted by hydrogen.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, the Bohr model only goes so far in explaining atomic structure and it was soon replaced by a deeper model based on a complete re-formulation of mechanics at the atomic scale. Schrödinger's equation expressly treats matter in terms of wave-like properties and puts the description of atomic structure (and experimental observations) into a probabalistic framework. Thus electrons are not described by classical orbits but instead occupy states whose mathematical description gives the probability of finding the electron at a given position: often, this is depicted as electron \"clouds\" in diagrams illustrating the \"truer\" nature of atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, certain important ideas originating in classical physics carry over into the wave-function treatment of the hydrogen atom. Chief amongst these are the ideas that electron states can be defined to have definite energy and definite angular momentum. Furthermore, the angular momentum is a vector quantity whose magnitude and direction both must be conserved in the absence of outside perturbations. The consequence of a detailed solution to Schrödinger's equation is that states are labelled by quantum numbers $n$, $l$, and $m_l$ that reflect both the energy and angular momentum of the system. How, in fact, the energy depends on these quantum numbers is a key question that we wish to investigate spectroscopically. The original Bohr model gives us the dependence on $n$, the principal quantum number associated with the radial distribution of the electrons. Using Schrödinger's equation, we want to know what connections, if any, also exists between the energy and angular momentum of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, careful experiments show that the information is incomplete for establishing these connections and a fourth quantum number is needed to completely describe the electron state, namely the electron's spin. More precisely, the magnitude s of the spin is fixed for all electrons and it is only the direction specified by the quantum number ms that varies. Associated with spin is a magnetic dipole moment and this magnetic dipole moment interacts with the magnetic field generated by the orbital motion of the same electron. Thus we expect that the energy will depend on how the particular combination of $l$, $m_l$, and $m_s$ describes the overall angular momentum of the system. Here it will be necessary to introduce yet another quantum number, $j$, that represents the vector combination of the orbital and spin angular momentum of the electron.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of a detailed theoretical analysis shows that there are several effects that jointly contribute to small shifts in energy as the combined angular momentum state is varied. This produces something called a \"fine structure\" in the observed optical spectra of atomic hydrogen. Thus another goal of this experiment is to assess the feasibility of measuring this fine structure given a detailed understanding of the capabilities of the spectroscopic instrumentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for completeness, it turns out that there is yet another magnetic interaction that the electron experiences. The nucleus (which is just a proton for the simplest isotope of hydrogen) also has spin and an associated magnetic momemnt. Thus there is a magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between the electron and the nucleus, and this produces even smaller changes to the energy state of the system. The resulting \"hyperfine\" structure will be found to be well outside the capabilities of the instrumentation for this experiment.\n"

    "## 1.2 The big ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "When materials are heated or otherwise exposed to external supplies of energy, one possible response is to give off light. A key idea is that this light carries information characteristic of the material from which it is emitted and even of fundamental properties of matter. In this experiment, an electric discharge running through a tube of low-pressure hydrogen creates a glowing mass of gas.  The discharge does two things: it dissociates gaseous hydrogen molecules into atoms and it excites the electrons in the atoms to higher energy states. The cascade of electrons from excited states back down to lower states is accompanied by release of energy in the form of photons of light. Thus the light that emerges yields information about the energy states available in hydrogen atoms. The frequencies $\\nu$ of these photons carry information about the change in energy $\\Delta E$ of the cascading electrons according to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta E = h \\nu.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $h$ is Planck's constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to extract information from the emitted light, we need some way of dispersing the light into its component frequencies. Notice here that the superposition is at play: we assume that light can propagate as a electromagnetic waves with a mixture of frequencies. The experimental goal is to sort out this mixture into its constituents, that is, to measure the spectrum of the light. To do this, we need a device called a dispersing element. The two most common types of dispersing elements in optical spectroscopy are prisms and diffraction gratings, with the latter serving by far as the most important type in research-grade instruments. Other optical system components, including a light collection lens, entrance and exit slits, mirrors, and a detector are combined with the dispersing element to make a spectrometer. A major goal of this experiment is to understand what determines the resolving power $\\mathbb{R}$ of a diffraction grating spectrometer. This is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{R} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\Delta \\lambda}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light being studied and $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the smallest separation in wavelength between two spectral components that can still be distinguished.\n",
    "\n",
    "(A note about notation: below we will use the symbol $R$ to refer to the Rydberg constant, not to be confused with the resolving power $\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that other possibilities might exist for dividing the light into its spectrum. A detector could be chosen that only responds to specific frequencies: in fact, this is done for radio-frequency and microwave spectroscopy. If the light propagates through a dispersive medium, that is, one in which the speed varies with frequency, one could – at least in principle – sort out pulses of light into constituents based on the time of propagation. In fact, the corresponding spectroscopy for energetic particles emitted from radioactive decays can be measured by so-called time-of-flight spectrometers. Finally, there is a third general method that does indeed play an important role in optical spectroscopy: interferometry. The wavelike nature of light can be exploited by only letting light pass through an instrument if waves of the light constructively interfere: this process is dependent on the wavelength and thus becomes a method for separating different parts of an optical spectrum. We will reconsider the use of interferometric techniques later in this experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to stress that the ideas here based on visible light spectroscopy can and do apply to a whole range of electromagnetic radiation. Thus there are spectroscopic methods for radiofrequency, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, and x-ray emissions from atomic and molecular sources. It is no accident that the energy transitions that we presently consider for the hydrogen discharge overlap with the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum visible to the human eye: processes in the solar photosphere that produce sunlight largely involve hydrogen and we have evolved to use this sunlight as our means of vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we compare sunlight to the spectrum of the hydrogen discharge lamp, we will observe a major difference: sunlight has a broad continuous spectrum while the discharge spectrum consists of a set of discrete lines. This raises many questions. One key question is: what processes can broaden the spectrum that would otherwise occur as narrow lines? Two such processes, Doppler broadening and collisional (pressure) broadening, could be subjects for further exploration: see the section \"Point of Departure.\"\n"

A goal is to predict energies of transition between states defined by an appropriate set of quantum numbers. We will see how the effect of reduced mass and the instrumental ability to distinguish between the spectra of hydrogen and deuterium will allow us to determine a fundamental property of nature: the ratio of the mass of the electron to the mass of the proton."

This predicts that the orbiting electron should spiral into the nucleus. Bohr sought a model that would only allow the electron to occupy certain orbits separated by finite steps in energy. Continuous radiation would be forbidden because a continuum of intermediate orbits would not be available. Moreover, there would be a smallest ground state orbit from which no further energy loss would be possible.\n",
